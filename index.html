            <p class="trans main-text trans" id="about-text"> Hi, I'm Ayan Chowdhury and I'm currently a third year Cognitive Science major and computer science minor. As you can tell from my major, I'm really interested in the mind, so I decided for my final project to create a website on <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/mindfulness/definition">mindfulness</a>. Berkeley students know all too well the stress and pressure the school can put on us sometimes, but the administration does not do a good job of providing resources on how to combat the stress and pressure. Hopefully the information I found on mindfulness is as useful to you as it was to me. On this webpage you will find information on three environments in which you can practice mindfulness. To begin learning about mindfulness, either click the brain to your left or scroll down to the next section to begin.</p>

        	<p class="trans main-text trans" id="about-text"> For many people, including myself, meditation is really hard. Sitting still for 5 - 10 minutes just focusing on breathing is really hard. Mindful walking can be seen as a form of meditation that is more engaging. To begin mindful walking all you need are comfortable clothes and shoes. To begin, start by standing still and allow yourself to notice and be aware of how your body feels. As you begin walking, be conscious of how you walk. Keep a heel-to-toe rhythm, and be aware as each foot contacts the ground. Breathe naturally, and allow for your attention to solely focus on your walking and breathing. You only have to do this for at least 5 minutes. If you feel like you can do this for longer, go for it. Keeping these tips in mind. Hopefully you find a little less stress after your walk.

            <p class="trans main-text trans" id="about-text"> As a student, one of the things I find most beneficial about mindfulness is the fact that it can be applied to my life as an undergrad. When talking about mindfulness and learning, what I simply mean is being aware of how you learn. As a student, it's easy to say that the way we're learning is fine and that it doesn't need to be changed up, but I think it's beneficial to at least try to best understand how we learn. One online resource I have found useful is <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning How to Learn</a>. This course helped open up my perspective to the various ways we can learn, and if this sounds interesting to you, you can go ahead and click the link and check the course out or scroll down for more info.</p>

            <h1 class="section-header trans">On Breathing</h1>
            <p class="trans main-text trans" id="about-text">One of the most popular ways of practicing mindfulness is mindful breathing. All you need to practice this form of mindfulness is a comfortable spot to sit and no distractions. If you're just starting out aim to practice mindful breathing for at least 5 mins, and continue from there. To practice mindful breathing, all you have to do is close your eyes, and focus on how you breathe. To breathe properly for this exercise, inhale deeply through your nostrils, hold your breath for a couple seconds, and then exhale through your mouth. By the end of this exercise in mindfulness you should notice yourself being a least a little less anxious, but if not no worries! Just like with any other exercise in life it takes practice.
